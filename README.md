This course provide a brief introduction into programming and data science using Python.
It was initially developed for teens, but is suitable for other ages as well.

The courses are build in complexity and some refer back to previous sessions.  The material
acts as a basis for explaining programming elements, and are better suited to be presented
by someone who already knows Python.

You will need access to a PC where you should install Anaconda for Python 3
See https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for download/installation instructions.  Once installed, 
copy all files in this .zip to "Your documents" folder.  In Anaconda, you will use Jupyter
to open the notebooks provided in this .zip file.  See http://jupyter.org/ for documentation
on how to use Jupyter.

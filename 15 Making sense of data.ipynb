    "We'll use a new library that makes it easy working with data sets.  The **pandas** (a.k.a. pd) library works very similar to numpy, except that it can mix different types of data.  You can find out what data it contains by simply printing it out (or getting meta-data using .info()).\n",

    "Pandas basically keeps information as a table.  Just like in numpy, you can filter for specific rows and you can decide which columns you want to work with.  It's possible to work with multiple columns at a time, but we'll focus on just the basics and typically use just one column (using the square bracket notation to say which column).\n",

    "To make it easier to see how it works, We'll be working with a data set (saved as a .csv file) containing more than 5000 movies with information coming from various sources, including an IMDB rating, gross income, budget, year, facebook likes, and more.  We'll also use this data set to plot some information, so we'll start by importing the usual things to plotting."
